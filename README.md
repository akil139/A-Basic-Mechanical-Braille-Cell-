# A-Basic-Mechanical-Braille-Cell-
*This braille design project aims to create an inclusive and accessible learning environment for visually impaired students. The project will involve designing braille materials for various subjects, including math, science, and language arts. The materials will be created using eco-friendly materials, and the designs will promote efficient use of space while maintaining legibility and readability. The project will also involve developing braille signage for public spaces such as elevators, restrooms, and classrooms to promote inclusivity and accessibility. The final design will be evaluated for its effectiveness in promoting accessibility and inclusivity and will be shared with schools and organizations to encourage the use of inclusive design practices. Overall, this project seeks to create a more accessible and inclusive learning environment for visually impaired students while promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility.*
